# TemplateDrivenFormTest

Angular 19 project based on `https://github.com/GregOnNet/talk-angular-template-driven-forms`.
Aim of this project is to compare Reactive forms to an alternative template driven approach.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
